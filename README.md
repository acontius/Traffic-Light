# Traffic-Light
Project Description for Digital Logic Circuits - Semester 4022

    Course Instructor: Dr. Shakoor Vakilian
    Project Supervisor: Navid Pakamoozesh

Problem Description

Imagine a four-way intersection where each path has a traffic signal equipped with green (go) and red (stop) lights. Each traffic light stays green for 60 seconds before turning red, allowing cars to pass through its path. A display shows remaining time for crossing the intersection to drivers continuously on a screen.

If any path crosses the intersection before its allotted 60 seconds, all traffic lights turn red. Sensors are installed to detect the presence of cars at each path, providing input to the system.

The intersections are interconnected in a chain-like manner, where each traffic light sends a signal to the next one to turn green.
Implementation Notes

    Use 7-segment displays for the countdown timer on the screen.
    Design should be at the gate level and structural in nature.
    Avoid using processes unless necessary.
    Provide clear input and output specifications.

Feel free to modify and expand the design according to your specific requirements.
